  * New upstream version

xmotd (1.16.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Workaround a bug in sbuild by specifying a non-pure-virtual package in
    build depends, closes: Bug#169986
  * Upgrade to standards-version 3.5.8 (pay attention to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)

 -- Marcin Owsiany <porridge@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jan 2003 20:01:27 +0100

xmotd (1.16.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed paths in manpage, thanks to Guido Guenther, closes: Bug#142356
  * Removed the HTML widget library, which is non-free. It was a serious
    policy violation (2.1.2), thus urgency=high.
    The library was disabled in 1.16-1 anyway.
  * Since libhtmlw is no longer included, and without it xmotd doesn't use any
    browser, bug 142407 no longer makes sense, thus closes: Bug#142407
  * Noted in manpage and README.Debian that HTML widget is no longer included.

xmotd (1.16-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopting this package, which closes: Bug#116505
  * Added missing backslashes in manpage, which closes: Bug#111678
  * Added a xmotd.man: target to Imakefile. This probably isn't the
    best way to fix the build, but I have more pleasant things to do
    than trying to parse several-thousand-lines-long imake template

xmotd (1.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

xmotd (1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "New" upstream version. It's not built with HTML support because
    that part of the code is non-free.
  * Alleviated the assumption that hppa is HP-UX, closes: #105084.
  * Added a menu file, closes: #76973.
  * Made XMotd.ad a symlink, not a copy of XMotd.
  * Install the binary in /usr/bin.
  * Added Build-Depends, other polishing.

xmotd (1.14b3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed app-defaults location, Closes: #86319
  * Since the maintainer of the package made only one release, in 1996,
    and there have been 2 NMU's since, it's orphaned. Set maintainer to
    debian-qa.
  * Converted to debhelper, since it was the quickest way to
    get it to fully comply with current policy.
