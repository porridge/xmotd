Description: message of the day browser for X
 Xmotd is a message-of-the-day browser for X11 (with additional
 sysvnews-like support for dumb terminals).  It displays a customizable
 message box which displays each message-of-the-day until the user has
 read them all, and then creates a stamp-file.
