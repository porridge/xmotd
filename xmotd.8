.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBxmotd\fP is a utility program (for X11 and dumb terminals) that
can be executed during the login process to display pertinent
messages (i.e. the message of the day) or to periodically check,
while the user is logged in, whether one or more message files have
been modified and display them if they have. Under X11, it displays a
customizable bitmap in the top-left corner. It provides for up to 3
lines of title-text (the length of the text depends on the size of
the font chosen). It has a \fI"Dismiss"\fP button below the bitmap
and a read-only text-widget that displays the message (or messages)
of the day. The date of the message (and optionally, the filename) is
displayed just above the text.

.LP
.B xmotd
can be configured to run in various modes: to always pop-up after
login or to pop-up only when the motd changes; to pop-down
automatically (without user-intervention) after a specified delay; to
run in the background and periodically check if the motd has changed
and display it. By default, 
.B xmotd
displays a message only if the file(s) was updated since the last
time the user read it.

.LP
If 
.B xmotd
has to display more than one file, the user is obliged to press the
\fI"Next Message"\fP button to view subsequent messages; the text of
the button changes to \fI"Dismiss"\fP when the last message is
displayed.

.LP
.B xmotd
defaults to text-only mode (output to 
.B stdout
when it cannot connect to an X display. This mode is useful for
running
.B xmotd
from user's
.I ~/.login
file in cases where they can also login via dialup.

.LP
This version of
.B xmotd
cannot display messages marked-up with HTML and xpm colour pixmap
logos, because the code that provided that functionality does not
comply with Debian Free Software Guidelines.

.SH OPERATION
.LP
.B xmotd
is usually run from the system \fIXsession\fP file via xdm(1), CDE
login and/or from the user's
.I ~/.login
file. At sites where xdm is not used, \fBxmotd\fP may be run from the
user's
.I ~/.xinitrc
where a (possibly) malicious user may intentionally or accidently
remove the \fBxmotd\fP invocation from the file.

.LP
When 
.B xmotd
first runs, it creates a timestamp file (by default called
.I .xmotd
) in the user's home-directory. On subsequent invocations,
.B xmotd
uses the date of this file to decide whether or not the
message-of-the-day (motd) files have been updated. If the date of the
motd file is later than the date on the \fI~/.xmotd\fP file, then
.B xmotd
will display the motd file; otherwise it will silently exit (if there
are no more files to be displayed and if \fB-wakeup\fP was not
used). When invoked with \fB-wakeup\fP, xmotd daemonizes itself and
goes to sleep for the specified sleep-period, periodically waking-up
to see if the motds have changed and then displaying them.

.LP
By default, 
.B xmotd
pops-down only when the \fI"Dismiss"\fP button is clicked; the rest
of the login-procedure then continues. This interactive behaviour can
be overridden so 
.B xmotd
will pop-down without user intervention, after a specified timeout
period.

.SH OPTIONS
All the standard 
.B X
options are valid. In addition, the following options, which may also
be set as resources in the app-defaults file (See RESOURCES), are
available:

.TP 8
.BI \-always

overrides 
.B xmotd
default behavior; the \fI~/.xmotd\fP time-stamp is ignored and the
message (or messages) is always displayed. Zero-length (empty) files
are displayed when this option is specified.

.TP 8
.BI \-atom " atom-name"

register 
.B xmotd
with name \fIatom-name\fP. By default, only one 
.B xmotd
is allowed to run (per user). You can permit multiple instances of
.B xmotd
to run by giving each instance an unique name. 
.B xmotd
will intern an atom with the X server, that combines the atom-name and
the user's login-id (e.g. \fI"xmotd.elf"\fP ; the default atom name
is \fI"xmotd"\fP); subsequent invocations of 
.B xmotd
will check if this atom exists and exit if it does.


.TP 8
.BI \-bitmaplogo " bitmap-filename"

specifies that the bitmap \fIbitmap-filename\fP is to be displayed in
place of the default bitmap, the "X" logo.  Ideally, the specified
bitmap should have a width and height of 100 pixels. If xpm support
is compiled-in, xpm colour pixmaps may be substituted instead. See
NOTES for additional details.

.TP 8
.BI \-help

displays command-line options usage.

.TP 8
.BI \-paranoid

(used with \fB-warnfile\fP) displays the warning message
unconditionally at every login (even when there are no messages to be
displayed).

.TP 8
.BI \-popdown " timeout"

exit or pop-down without user intervention, \fItimeout\fP seconds
after being invoked. The user can dismiss \fBxmotd\fP at any time
before the timeout, by clicking on the \fI"Dismiss"\fP button. This
option is only valid at the initial login; it is ignored on
subsequent pop-ups when \fBxmotd\fP is invoked with \fB-wakeup\fP.

.TP 8
.BI \-showfilename

displays the filename of the file currently being viewed (as it
appears on the command-line), alongside the date.

.TP 8
.BI \-stampfile " stamp-filename"

overrides the default timestamp filename, \fI~/.xmotd\fP, and uses
\fIstamp-filename\fP instead.

.TP 8
.BI \-tail

display the end of a file; the text is automatically scrolled so the
end of the file is visible.

.TP 8
.BI \-usedomains

uses local domain-name based time-stamping in cases where user's
home-directories are shared (NFS mounted) across various domains.
Time-stamps are created (and checked) with appropriate domain-names
appended.

.TP 8
.BI \-warnfile " warning-filename"

specifies a file containing a standard message used to warn users of
the consequences of deviance and sundry unlawful things they should
not even \fIthink\fP of doing on your network; your network's rules of
use, information about disk quotas, modem charges and printer
accounting fees (used with \fB-paranoid\fP).

.TP 8
.BI \-wakeup " sleep-period"

causes \fBxmotd\fP to run in the background and wakeup periodically
every \fIsleep-period\fP hours to check whether the files have been
modified and therefore need to be (re-)displayed. The sleep period is
specified as a floating point number where the fractional portion
indicates the number of minutes. For example, a sleep-period of 0.25
indicates 15 minutes (one quarter of an hour) and a sleep-period of
1.5 indicates one and one-half hours; the minimum (enforced)
sleep-period is 1 minute. The \fB-wakeup\fP option is useful at sites
where users with personal workstations never log-out. See NOTES for
additional details.

.TP 8
.I file [file2 ... ]

one or more files to be displayed may be specified. The file(s)
contain the text of the message(s) of the day. If HTML support is
compiled-in the motd files should be marked-up with HTML.

.TP 8
.I directory

Instead of supplying one or more files on the command-line,
\fBxmotd\fP may be supplied a \fIdirectory\fP containing file(s) to
be displayed. \fBxmotd\fP will scan the directory and display all the
files contained therein, that need to be displayed. This feature is
useful when used with the \fB-wakeup\fP option; upon waking-up,
\fBxmotd\fP will re-scan the directory for any files (including new
files that have been subsequently added) that need to be displayed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Give \fBxmotd\fP a geometry option to tell it to pop-up at a location
other than 0,0 and read-in the message-of-the-day from the file
\fI/usr/local/motd\fP:
.nf

   xmotd -geometry +20+20 /usr/local/motd
.fi
.LP
Use a bigger window (900x600) and automatically position it (at
top-left corner at 20,20), always pop-up \fBxmotd\fP displaying the
contents of \fI/usr/local/motd\fP, ignoring the user's \fI~/.xmotd\fP
timestamp-file and pop-down after 20 seconds:
.nf

   xmotd -geom 900x600+20+20 -always -popdown 20 /usr/local/motd
.fi

.LP
Use a custom bitmap in the file \fI/usr/local/xmotd.bm\fP:
.nf

   xmotd -geom +5+5 -bitmaplogo /usr/local/xmotd.bm /usr/local/motd
.fi

.LP
In the following example, all the files in \fI/usr/local/messages/\fP will
be checked for modification times greater than the time-stamp and
only those files will be displayed and every eight and a half hours,
\fBxmotd\fP will check if any files have changed (or new ones added)
and display them if necessary:
.nf

   xmotd -geom +5+5 -wakeup 8.5 /usr/local/messages/ 
.fi

To display a warning-message every time the user logs-in (even when
no messages need to be displayed), and to display the filenames of
the files being viewed, use:
.nf

   xmotd -geom +5+5 -warnfile /usr/local/WARNING -paranoid \\
      -showfilename /usr/local/motds/
.fi

X resources may be changed from the command-line using the \fB-xrm\fP
option. This example (typed as a single line) illustrates how
\fBxmotd\fP can be customized exclusively from the command-line:

.nf

    xmotd -always \\
        -xrm "*title.label: Top 10 Disk Hogs\\n As of midnight\\n " \\
        -xrm "*title.foreground: yellow" \\
        -xrm "*form.background: red" \\
        -xrm "*title.background: red" \\
        -xrm "*logo.background: pink" \\
        -xrm "*text*font: -adobe-times-bold-*-normal-*-*-180-*" \\
        -geometry 500x650-1-1 \\
        -bitmaplogo /usr/common/choke.xbm 
        -popdown 10 \\
        /usr/common/accounting/top &

.fi

.SH RESOURCES

editres(1) may be used to edit resources. The application class-name
is \fIXMotd\fP.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Always\fP (set to either \fBTrue\fP or
\fBFalse\fP) is equivalent to the \fB-always\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Atom\fP (set to the name of the atom
\fBxmotd\fP is registered with) is equivalent to the \fB-atom\fP
command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*BitmapLogo\fP (set to the path and filename of
the bitmap/pixmap-file) is equivalent to the \fB-bitmaplogo\fP
command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Browser\fP (set to the path and filename of
the browser to be used when users click on an URL (HTML version
only)) is equivalent to the \fB-browser\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Paranoid\fP (set to \fBTrue/False\fP) is
equivalent to the \fB-paranoid\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Popdown\fP (set to the number of seconds) is
equivalent to the \fB-popdown\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*UseDomains\fP (set to \fBTrue/False\fP) is
equivalent to the \fB-usedomains\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*ShowFilename\fP (set to \fBTrue/False\fP) is

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Tail\fP (set to \fBTrue/False\fP) is
equivalent to the \fB-tail\fP command-line option.

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*Wakeup\fP (set to an floating-point number
representing hours) is equivalent to the \fB-wakeup\fP command-line

.LP
The resource: \fIXMotd*title.label\fP (set to a possibly multi-line
string) may be used to customize the title.

By default, the title is the single line:\fI"Message Of The
Day\\n\\n\\n"\fP (the 2-character sequence, \fI"\\n"\fP, indicates a
carriage-return).

For example, if you want a 2 line title that reads:
.nf

         This is the
      Message of the Day
.fi

the resource can be specified as:
.nf

       *title.label: \\       This is the\\nMessage of the Day\\n\\n
.fi

Note that the first backslash quotes the leading spaces that indent
the words, \fB"This is the"\fP.

.SH NOTES

The \fB-always\fP option is considered fascist; it is provided merely
for completeness and for testing purposes.

If xpm support is compiled-in, \fBxmotd -help\fP will print the words
\fI"bitmap/pixmap"\fP for the \fB-bitmaplogo\fP description instead
of just \fI"bitmap"\fP.

Under dumb-terminal mode, all command-line options are ignored with
the exception of \fB-stampfile\fP and \fB-wakeup\fP; the
\fB-always\fP option is equivalent to cat'ing the motd from the
\fI~/.login\fP file; and \fB-popdown\fP is not really relevant. Both
\fB-warnfile\fP and \fB-paranoid\fP may be simulated with appropriate
cat(1) and more(1) commands.

\fBxmotd\fP processes invoked with \fB-wakeup\fP will continue
sleeping, "S" in the ps(1) status field, after the user has
logged-out until the sleep timeout expires. Only when \fBxmotd\fP
wakes-up, will it detect that the user has logged-out and
exit. \fBxmotd\fP's logout-detection routine relies on the xdm(1)
support scripts \fBGiveConsole\fP (which chown's \fB/dev/console\fP
to the user) and \fBTakeConsole\fP (which chown's \fB/dev/console\fP
back to root) setting the correct permissions and ownership on
\fB/dev/console\fP. When \fBxmotd\fP wakes-up, it attempts to open(2)
\fB/dev/console\fP for reading; if this open fails, it is an
indication that the user has logged out because \fBTakeConsole\fP has
changed ownership of the console.

.SH BUGS

There are no provisions for displaying embedded images in the HTML
version of \fBxmotd\fP (until a stable XmHTML widget is available, or
perhaps when \fBxmotd\fP is ported to the GTK).

At least one other.
